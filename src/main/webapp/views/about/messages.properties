info.about.text1= Shipmee is everything you've always wanted, born of a very simple idea. We know that memory is not infallible, so shipmee helps to solve those bad times after knowing that you have forgotten something in another place, or simply helps you to get what you want to another place.
info.about.text2=We want to make a better world, reducing costs and even contributing to the environment, our drivers are not professionals, they only take advantage of their trips to carry another person's package. An innovative idea with which from now on if you want to carry something say: Shipmee is what I need.
